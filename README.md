## Welcome to Foxonwow's Extension Gallery!

Hello! I'm **Foxonwow**, but you may know me from GitHub as *Pfoxj* or *CTRLCMDmaster*, but, on Scratch, I go by Foxonwow.

I've decided to create my **own extension gallery**, based on SharkPool's!

This gallery features **all of my extensions**, including ones that were originally rejected by PenguinMod, but this isn’t just retaliation!

My mission is to show the world that extensions like mine can actually ***WORK***, to help me, and other creators reach success around the various other extension galleries.

Because, yeah, I know from experience that Penguinmod's moderation for extensions can be ***HARSH*** sometimes, especially for new creators.
So, maybe this gallery will be seen by the Penguinmod team. Maybe, they'll double-check just a *bit* more.

Because, I'm really just trying to help **support and grow the community** of custom extension creators and users alike!
